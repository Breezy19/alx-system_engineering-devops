# Postmortem: Web Stack Outage on XYZ Platform

### Issue Summary
**Duration:** The outage lasted from 2:00 PM to 4:30 PM EST on November 10, 2023.  
**Impact:** Approximately 60% of our user base experienced slow response times and intermittent downtime on our main service portal. The primary issue was a bottleneck in our database queries, leading to delayed data retrieval and processing.  
**Root Cause:** The root cause was identified as inefficient database indexing, compounded by a recent surge in user activity.

### Timeline
- **2:00 PM** - Issue detected when our monitoring system alerted the IT team about unusual spikes in database response time.
- **2:05 PM** - Initial assumption focused on a potential DDoS attack; network traffic was analyzed, revealing normal patterns.
- **2:30 PM** - Further investigation by the database team suggested possible database performance issues. Query logs were reviewed for anomalies.
- **3:00 PM** - Several misleading paths were pursued, including examining recent code deployments and server hardware issues.
- **3:30 PM** - Incident escalated to senior database administrators, who identified inefficient indexing on key tables as the probable cause.
- **4:00 PM** - Implemented temporary query optimizations and initiated reindexing of affected database tables.
- **4:30 PM** - Service restored to full functionality; monitoring continued for stability.

### Root Cause and Resolution
**Root Cause:** The primary issue was inefficient indexing within our database. This flaw became apparent under the increased load of recent user activity. The lack of appropriate indexes led to full table scans, causing significant delays in query processing.

**Resolution:** The immediate fix involved optimizing critical queries and reindexing key database tables. This improved query efficiency and reduced the load on the database server, resolving the immediate performance issues.

### Corrective and Preventative Measures
To prevent a recurrence of this issue and improve overall system resilience, we propose the following measures:

1. **Review and Optimize Database Indexes:** Regular audits of database indexes to ensure they are optimized for current usage patterns.
2. **Enhanced Monitoring:** Implement more granular monitoring for database performance, including query response times and table scans.
3. **Load Testing:** Conduct regular load testing to simulate high-traffic scenarios and identify potential bottlenecks.
4. **Capacity Planning:** Review current hardware and consider upgrades to handle increased load, factoring in recent user growth trends.
5. **Training and Documentation:** Provide additional training for the IT team on database performance optimization and ensure that all procedures are well-documented.
6. **Post-Deployment Checks:** Establish a protocol for post-deployment checks that include database performance monitoring to catch any potential issues early.

By addressing these areas, we aim to not only fix the current issue but also strengthen our system against future challenges. Our goal is to ensure high availability and performance consistency for all our users.
